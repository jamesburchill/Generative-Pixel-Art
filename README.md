# Generative-Pixel-Art (BASIC edition)
Creates pixel art from classic written works.

Whatever text file you place in the _data folder (named source.txt) will be read and turned into simple pixel art. I used classic works from 
Project Gutenberg @ https://www.gutenberg.org - The sample pixel art included was generated using Bram Stoker's Dracula. 

Using each character, it draws a circle (using pygame) of RADIUS and COLOUR. 
A certain amount of system randomness is used to affect the RADIUS of matched and unmatched characters.
The total number of chars determines the dimensions of the finished file, 160,000 characters will create a 400 x 400 image
The samples included are just shy of 1000 x 1000 pixels. Zoom in for greater detail :)

I wanted to keep it simple, use common and easy to understand libraries, hence pygame. I'm working on other, more complex generative pixel art and will share details later. Until then, enjoy and happy "painting" üëç
